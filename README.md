# OpenPatents

Patents which are not exclusive. Patents for all. Patents for sustainable  development.

-----------------

Here's a list of things I personally am thankful for:

1. People behind WWW
2. People behind FSF and GNU
3. People behind Linux
4. People behind git
5. People behind GitHub - so that at least whole world can share code and in effect ideas for free.

If you are here reading this list, you should be thankful for such things and awesome people too.

What do you mean by OpenPatents?
---

You might be thinking that a patent itself stands for exclusive territorial right - and you are right. What I mean by OpenPatents is basically getting rid of pissing to mark the territory. 

OpenPatents intend to provide you with public bragging rights. It doesn't intend to provide you with power enough to file a lawsuit.

**What happens when someone violates your OpenPatent?**

There is no such thing as violating an OpenPatent. OpenPatent is supposed to allow people to share ideas and thus work on other's ideas too. If you want to restrict people, in certain cases and in certain ways, you have to deploy your prototype with appropriate license: MIT, BSD, Apache, GNU/GPL, Artistic etc.

**I still do not understand the need for it?**

Think: You are fed up with the patent system and patents; especially in software field or even computation field, and you have this great idea which can turn whole world upside down (even for a few nanoseconds) and you want nobody to have the power that comes with it, what do you do? **You distribute it faster than someone else can claim it for personal or commercial use.**

Do: Create a prototype and slap an appropriate license to it. OpenPatent doesn't even require an attribution. It's merely a bragging right which is documented somewhere public and **a way to stop future patent application the subject**. Your prototype however can have GNU/GPL, MIT or any other license as you see fit.

Spread: The idea.

**What do I need to do to file an OpenPatent?**

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add your stuff in OpenPatents/YYYY/MM/DD/LastName/FirstName/{incremental number}-{title of OpenPatent}.[txt|pdf|doc|...]
3. You are done. But create a pull request anyway for others to see it.
4. Create your document that resembles a legal patent: including claims, diagrams, prototypes, prior art etc.

Remember to add at least two formats, **text format is mandatory**.

**What else?**

Read more to understand the concept behind it.

Rationale behind OpenPatents - What it is and what it is not.
---

1. If you want to make money, go make it by working on a product; and not by just jotting down ideas and not by just building a prototype and not by paying outrageous sum of money.
2. If you want bragging rights, OpenPatents will provide you those anyway.
3. If you believe that Earth and its resources are meant to be shared.
4. If your idea is important, good people (who are not evil) make profit from it, they will share the rewards with you anyway.
5. To encourage development and openness in sharing ideas.
6. Its a personal choice.
7. If you reach a breakthrough idea via funding/paid-research (someone else paid you to research), you might have to follow their laws, by-laws and contracts regarding patent/OpenPatent.
8. OpenPatents do not intend to violate Intellectual Property that already is filed; neither is that a goal.
9. The Goal of OpenPatents is to share ideas and benefits from them based on altruistic behavior.
10. An OpenPatent can be filed here.
11. An OpenPatent can not be filed for already granted or pending patents. That's illegal anyway and any court will see through it.
12. An OpenPatent, however, will stop a future similar patent because idea would have been become part of a common knowledge or state of the art. In that manner, a patent application wouldn't be able to prove novelty of the idea.
13. OpenPatent encourages you to also build a prototype so that Novelty, Invention and Usefulness can be killed with a single stone; thus making a future patent application futile.
14. One of the higher goals of OpenPatents is to make Intellectual Property Laws useless and convert effectivey, any book on IP Law and it's practice, into a pillow or heavy paperweight.
15. It's a common effort, so participate in freeing the future.
16. Goals: Thwart patent trolls. Stop vague patents from seeing day of light.
 

What prompted it?
---

**Utterly useless and frivolous patents, lawsuits and compromises**; such as:

1. http://www.google.co.in/patents/US7099862
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxcc3SM_KA
3. General patent trolls: companies, individuals
4. Please provide more...
 

**Costs**

1. Costs for application of a patent goes to thousands of dollars (when a dollar is 66 Indian Rupees, circa 2016); this point alone is enough to demonstrate that it helps people who have money (are rich enough) to claim a patent.
2. A patent system should facilitate research among general populace, which is much healthier for Earth than a bunch of people spending money of research and coming up to find business-only applications. This is such a huge cost for society that it might take a book to just explain the problems.


**Current legal patent systems are not future proof**

1. It's a sort of tax for people to come in future. Future generations might get stifled by lack of freedom to express their ideas and exercise their creativity.
2. Though, patents have expiry dates, some institutes and individuals find ways to keep their patents valid by renewing, tweaking and other ways.
3. Patent duration should be long enough to let patent holder come up with a working product; after that it should become void. OpenPatents actually remove that restriction too.


Anubhav, this is all good but it already exists?

I am not aware of such prior art. (It's a pun)

Please let me know if similar ideas exist and I'll try to collaborate with such projects. I am aware of FSF and personally use open sources applications as much as possible.

Thanks.


License

Jury is still out on what to do with license for this repo and OpenPatents. Right now it's MIT.
